The very best dub artist + The very best tip hop artist. This album is great.

=== Salmonella Dub / Inside the Dub Plates / Problems ===
This particular track was my favourite at the start of my exploration of the joys of weed, whilst living in New Zealand. It brings back numerous hazy and fond memories. And I hope it can be the catalyst for the creation of some new memories for the Bongcast listeners.

Turntablism. Bong hits. Chill music. Everything a bongcast should include. Enjoy!

I played a jimkata track during the precast and people seemed to like it, so here's a track for the cast.

If you haven't heard this song yet, you will now.  It's a great one, and well, their singer can wail and looks like this:

=== OM / Advaitic Songs / State Of Non-Return ===
I can't believe we didn't have OM for a Bongcast yet, so here's a song from their latest offering. As with all their stuff this song grew tremendously on me, so if it doesn't blow you away right now that is probably why.

I'll let the music speak for itself, let's embark on a spiritual journey to the state of non-return.....

=== Talking Heads / Little Creatures / Stay Up Late ===
It's a little more ironic than I'd like, and very much more an oldie than something fresh, but I love it and circumstances demand it. Ave Lux!

=== Camille Yarbrough / Iron Pot Cooker / Take Yo' Praise ===
So we all know the fatboy slim song praise you, but the sample its taken from is just as good. a real soulful number. this one definitely sticks out from the album as the rest are more in the style of spoken word.
