=== Pepe Deluxé / Beatitude / Just Let Go ===
You may remember Pepe Deluxé from an earlier bongcast, when I played the opening track off the best record of 2012. Well, it turns out that Pepe Deluxé is so fresh even their old records are fresh. That's fresh! Also this song makes me think of alpaca, and I laugh every time. I hope you do, too.

=== Yeasayer / Fragrant World / Blue Paper ===
A wonderful track from yeasayer's latest album, Fragrant World.
“Our theory was that it’s kind of easy to make a pretty song, and it’s also kind of easy to make weird sounds, but it’s difficult to make those two things work together,” ~band member Anand Wilder

A poppy french group pretending to be english in america, sung with the ennui that only a frenchman can muster.

=== Romare / Meditations on Afrocentrism / The Blues (It Began In Africa) ===
If this isn't your thing, I can see how this might drive you nuts and I apologize (although not actually). On the other hand, if you're more like the great kafitz, you may find you cannot get enough of it. It's been a long time since I found a song that's grown on me so long and it sure doesn't hurt the rest of the album is pretty nice as well.

=== Public Enemy / Most of My Heroes Still Don't Appear On No Stamp / Rltk ===
Here's a cut from the most recent album.  When I heard that they had released a new album I thought the worst, pop music and fluff.  The good news is that there are a few tracks that still sound like proper Public Enemy.

=== VersaEmerge / Fixed at Zero / Figure It Out ===

Just found the Pop-Punk band from Florida VersaEmerge's full length album the other day and I've been hooked on this song ever since. The vocal chords have haunted my brain as have the rhythm of the lyrics offsetting that of the guitar riff for a track that I keep coming back to over and over again. While the lyrics leave me a bit wanting, it's the minor second vocals that keep me listening. This may be a bit more poppy than we get in here, but I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I do :D

=== Big fish / ? / Mediaburen (The media cage)===

Struggled to find a pick for this week, anyway Big fish is a 90s youth punk rock band or whatever from Sweden, with its sound being described as "a middle age rave at a scrapyard", and this song is one of my favourites, its refrain translates roughly to 
"In my little house with electronic lights
I see everything clear
The screen radiates heat
absolutely wonderful
In a TV, I would stay where I can find peace
it can certainly donate
total apathy, that's how it will be
I want to avoid thinking"

and yeah that rimes in swedish, so enjoy some Viking music.

=== Hella Comet / Celebrate Your Loss / Bury the Hatchet ===
Ecstatic live performance by an Austrian band I had no idea existed. I saw them twice this summer and they blew my brain to smithereens both times (with help of copious amounts of beer and weed, naturally). The frontwoman/singer/guitarist is really something else to behold on stage, she gets lost in her music completely and rocks out putting most men to shame.

Here is a 20 min. live vid in decent quality if you're interested: http://youtu.be/ZrOYMJ06Qwg

=== Ghost / Opus Eponymous / Con Clavi Con Dio ===

Ghost is an amazing Swedish band featuring Papa Emeritus and his Nameless Ghouls.   Not much is known about this mysterious band including their identities,  but what is known is these guys are bringing Black Metal back to it's roots.   Nobody has seen or heard a band like this since Mercyful Fate.   I wish I could pick the whole album for this bongcast, instead you get just a taste.

=== Phillip Glass / Glassworks / Facades ===

For any one who is not already familiar with his work, Phillip Glass is said to be one of the most influential composers of the late 20th century, his music is commonly described as minimalist. Phillip Glass however, prefers to describe his work as "music with repetitive structures".

Pretty sure I could write a whole lot of interesting nonsense about this weird psych pseudo-soundtrack of a record, but I'm not going to. All you need to know is that the track, translated from French reads, "The King of Flies and the Jam of Flies".
