=== Mouse on Mars / Idiology / Actionist Respoke ===
This might be the single greatest IDM track ever recorded. I've been listening to a bunch of MoM lately, I am convinced that the term "I", the self is idiological and can be dispensed with.

=== Assemble Head in Sunburst Sound / Manzanita / Blue Wire ===
I was going to pick something off the new Can 3cd, but this brand new assemble head is so goddamn awesome, it needs to be shared immediately. One of the best psych stoner/experimental bands out there. This song is pretty straightforward blues but the vibe is killer

I really recommend this album, enjoy

"Africa" is a song by rock band Toto, and one of the band's most recognizable songs. It was included on their 1982 album Toto IV, and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in February 1983 and number three on the UK Singles Chart the same month. The song was written by the band's keyboardist/vocalist David Paich and drummer Jeff Porcaro.

Although I've had this album for quite some time it is definitely deserving of a bongcast pick. I highly recommend listening to the album in its entirety. Enjoy this psychedelic journey into the inner realm and discover your true infinite self!

One of the best metal albums of 2007 by one of the best metal bands ever (and this is their best album), no exaggeration. Sweepingly epic and emotional and FUCKING AWESOME.

"Black International is a post punk-influenced group from Edinburgh, Scotland. The band was formed in late 2006 by Edinburgh College of Art graduates Stewart Allan (Vocals & Guitar) and Craig Peebles (Drums) with the intention of making stripped down, economical, brutal pop music."

=== Anais Mitchell / Hadestown / Why We Build The Wall (live) ===
Heard this lass from my mate James - the guy that's done quite a few Bongcasts with me now. Can't say I paid her much attention at first but I did buy us tickets to her show a few weeks ago (for his birthday), and was subsequently blown away.

Great voice, great music, great accompanying band... all great. But this tune in particular really caught my ears. It comes from a folk opera underworld concept style album she did a couple of years ago called Hadestown. The concept being a variation on the Ancient Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, where Orpheus must embark on a quest to rescue his wife Eurydice from the underworld. Cunning eh? You could (and should) compare it to Tom Waits' epic concept record "The Black Rider".

So aye, I've picked "Why We Build The Wall" because there's something about it that's timeless to me. Hopefully you'll know what I mean once you've digested the lyrics and the way they unwind. While the album version is really fucking cool and fits into the album's style and narrative like dSyrup at a silver enthusiast gangbang, I've gone for a live acoustic version. Hope you dig.

There are things about this track which remind me of Ultrasonic Sound by Hive from the Matrix Soundtrack. All in all, this album is a pretty good mix of hip hop with some rock and downtempo tracks thrown in, with this track closing us out. Enjoy the deep synth and beats!
