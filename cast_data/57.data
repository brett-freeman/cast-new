=== Bob Dylan / No Direction Home / Maggie's Farm ===

Let me set the picture.   It's Sunday at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival.  He heard the earlier day that the festival organizers were upset about bands using electric guitars or amps.  "Well, fuck them if they think they can keep electricity out of here, I'll do it." Dylan shows up on the third day with Mike Bloomfield and the rest of his band,  sporting a Stratocaster instead of his staple acoustic guitar.  The crowd is stunned,  the place is littered with mostly boo's and scattered clapping. Next, with a few strums on his electric guitar, he turns around and shouts to the band "LET'S GO!" and he busts into this...

=== Stan SB / Tears in Rain / ? ===

This is probably the first and only time I'll ever pick a DnB track, but FUCK this one is brilliant.  This isn't from an album or anything, this guy is just an independent guy making music for soundcloud/youtube, although he's amassed a large e-following so Stan SB is a name you might start hearing.

=== Unicorn Trap / Nothing is True / ? ===

Taken from a night of live recorded mushroom jams at my house in late July with the hippy and the bass player (with no bass), I spent September putting this together. A lot of the song was re-arranged and/or re-recorded. Another finished track, praise the lords of green. 

Once I decide on a description and genre tags, I'll be uploading it to soundcloud. http://soundcloud.com/unicorn-trap

=== Sula Bassana / Dark Days / Departure ===
Some relatively unknown spacey psychedelica from Germany, the solo project of multi-instrumentalist and psychonaut Dave Schmidt. The second song of the album that will take you on a trip to space, leaving you open to explore dark corners of your self you had not yet dared to venture to. The album was inspired by the awesome artwork by [http://luluartwork.jimdo.com/gallery/lp-cd-covers/ Lulu Komet] who plays bass in Dave's other project Electric Moon (also highly recommended).

=== Mala / Mala in Cuba / Mulata ===

http://images.xlr8r.com/files/features/frontpage_images/malamain_091212.jpg

Mala, one of the heavyweight originators of the 'dubstep' sound recently recorded with musicians in Cuba and released a 14 song album of all original sounds.  Really lovely stuff. "Mulata" which I have selected for this month's bongcast is well described as having qualities of a smoky purple salsa. I think it's fitting. Volume increase would be highly recommended.

Sometimes I just don't quite find anything new that is awesome enough to be bongcast worthy, thusly, I have dug back into the fleshy backlogs to find one of my favorite gems. Great psychedelic indie rock pop band that I've loved for years and this track off their last album is absolutely superb. Great live show, too. Enjoy!

=== Latimore / Let's Straighten It Out / Let's Straighten It Out ===
Here's a guy from the 70s Miami soul scene who never really got anywhere. His biggest problem was with his early albums like this he started off solid as fuck but as time went on, the albums he put out got cheesier and cheesier (this song is a prime example, this version is his earliest which isnt anywhere on youtube which has instead the cheesiest 80s bullshit version I could imagine). I randomly downloaded him from oink and never have seen on what or waffles or anything since (and ofc I've been too lazy to put it there). About two years ago I deleted all the music I had accumulated off the internet since I began seriously downloading music so I was excited to find a blog with his discography on it which you can find here: http://www.funkmysoul.gr/?p=664
