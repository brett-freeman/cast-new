New Ufomammut, best enjoyed live at the Desertfest Berlin with Strings (did you even see any of their gig?). Awesome visuals to go with the performance and I was tripping ballz!

'Future garage'. I dunno. Its rhythmically and melodically interesting and at a good tempo. Lots of quality producers coming up on this stuff, IMO.

These guys are fairly local, from Dallas/Fort Worth, and I've had the pleasure of meeting them, seeing them live, and reviewing one of their albums (they liked my review!). I think they're really unique and deserve more attention than they get. They started out playing melodic black metal, but they've switched to 8-bit metal and it's pretty original and neat.

This is only the most awesome themesong I have ever heard. Chillaxy tunes and intriguing lyrics. Watch the movie, if you like travel stories.

Maybe it's not the freshest pick but this weekend is the unofficial start of summer. Nothing like some fine Cali surf rock to gear you up for beaches, bbqs, swimming, camping, festivals, ice cream, no school, sleeping in, etc etc.

=== Sea Level / Sea Level / Grand Larceny ===

http://img195.imageshack.us/img195/1123/51gekhieflsl500aa300.jpg

Sea Level is the name of a fusion group that mixed jazz, blues and rock. It existed between 1976 and 1981. Initially, it was an offshoot of The Allman Brothers Band, but as tensions grew between the loss of two of its founding members, and personal grievances between Gregg Allman and other bandmates and associates, Sea Level took on a life of its own as an independent band.

After the initial destruction of the Allman Brothers Band, the refugees who evolved into Sea Level were the trio "We Three"; comprising bassist Lamar Williams, drummer Jaimoe and Chuck Leavell (piano, keyboards, vocals), all then-members of the Allman Brothers, the trio would occasionally open shows for the group in 1975 and 1976. With the Allmans' first disbanding in 1976, the trio added guitarist Jimmy Nalls and named the band based on a phonetic pun of their new bandleader's name: "C. Leavell". They toured relentlessly, experimenting on and refining their sound, eventually signing with Capricorn Records (home of the Allman Brothers) and recording their self-titled debut album in 1977.

This albums going on 10 years now but in my opinion is one of the better lounge albums to date. That's right suckers, hot, steamy, downtempo lounge. So grab your damn mojito and let's enjoy this fine summer weather in style.

This is one of my favorite tracks from a friend's first release. He's undoubtedly one of the strongest influences in my musical interests to this day, and so to give him thanks for the music I've now grown to love, I present this offering to the Bongcast.

I'm sure you've all either a) heard this and hate it or b) are going to assume this is like most dubstep (the sound of a spaceship malfunctioning) but it's pretty good. Plus I've been playing a lot of AC:R and it reminds me of it. So suck my plums.
