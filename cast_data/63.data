=== Pavla & Noura / Don't Break My Love: A Collection of Lost Memories from Clown & Sunset ("The Prism") / Don't Owe Me a Thing ===
The Prism is, in fact, a small aluminum cube with four buttons and two headphone slots (so you can share the music with a loved one). Contained within its walls are 12 “mostly unreleased” tracks from Nicolas Jaar’s label that make up a compilation called Don’t Break My Love, including cuts from Nicolas Jaar, Pavla and Noura, Valentin Strip and Just Friends. I also love giant hairy cocks

I dedicate this song to dmsuperman because he is so goth that he had to take the first place on the list. 

Also I'm a bitch.

Lately I've been listening to whole lotta electro swing, and I wanted to share this with you guys.
P.S.: If anyone has some recommendations on (electro) swing, I'd love to hear them.

=== The Reign of Kindo / This is What Happens / Thrill of the Fall ===
I guess I got this from a What Staff Pick a while back, but never listened to the album until a few weeks ago. Since then I've found a new favorite album to listen to, analyze, appreciate, and belt out in the car to. I love that this track, the first in the album, kicks off with a strange time signature of 7/8 with strong vocals and harmonics. Enjoy!
