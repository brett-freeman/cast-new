=== Pepe Deluxé / Queen of the Wave / Queenswave ===
The introductory track of "an esoteric pop opera in three parts". It is an album inspired by Atlantean science and technology (c. 10,000 B.C.) and includes such instruments as The Great Stalacpipe Organ, which is the largest musical instrument in the world, as well as the Psychical Predictor crafted by one Professor A.D. Conrow and a 500,000 volt Tesla Coil Synthesizer, one of the very few in use today.  The band is a pair of noblemen: James Spectrum, Baron of Sealand, and Paul Malmström, Explorer of Worlds Both Known and Unknown. To these gentlemen the Great Nation of Pacifica gives due reverence. Give this song – nay, this entire album – your most serious attention.

What fine timing, I finished this song last night. This song was started in August 2011 and then re-visited and finished in March 2012 . I am very happy with the results and I purposely did not smash the master to keep the dynamic range.

last song on the album. some weird swedish guy, gets away with a lot of weird non-rhymes because of his absurd accent. kind of haunting. i dont always contribute as an idler, but when i do, im an afker.

Off the newest album of one of my favourite folk-pop singer/songwriters. The fiddle solo is pretty awesome.

I don't know how you guys feel about female vocalists but if Britney Spears is on here, why not. I kind of like this one and find this a pretty cool track.

HAIL SATAN. Best live band I've ever seen. The atmosphere is *incredible*. I had a religious experience. Quite the trip.

Bad Religion's somewhat disastrous foray into prog-rock back in the early 1980s.  Almost destroyed the band before it got off the ground, but the music is actually pretty good.

=== Dr. Dog / Be the Void / Heavy Light ===

Among my favorite bands, these guys have consistently put out quality albums since the early naughts. Their latest album is no exception. Having gotten the chance to see them for the 5th time live last night, I was once again blown away. They played this tune live and while the album doesn't quite do it justice it is still tremendously awesome. Highly recommended!

West coast rapper Andre Nickatina pairs up with Equipto to produce some sick music. Andre's flow and delivery are nasty.

=== Ayreon / The Human Equation / Day Eleven - Love ===

I know we try to avoid repeats on casts, but I think four years is a long enough gap! I picked this track for the 5th Bongcast back in 2008, and still love it now 46 casts later. Anyone who hasn't heard of Ayreon should grab this album, it's probably one of the best progressive rock albums I've ever listened to. Brett and I were just discussing how we can't believe how long we've known some of you guys now...time flies! Enjoy the tune.
