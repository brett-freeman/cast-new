=== Ismahl / angL / Unhealer ===
Ismahl is some sort of prog/avantgarde/black metal genius,  apparently he's rather popular but I never heard of him until recently.  After spending an afternoon listening to 3 of his albums, it dawned on me his standard norweigen black metal vocals would turn a lot of people off.  It was really hard for me to pick a track, until I heard this track, and my mind was BLOWN.

Let's play a Decembercast game...  Why was EnrageD's mind blown?

=== Toro y Moi / Anything in Return / Never Matter ===
I've practically had this song on repeat since downloading this album. Listen to that bit of piano action with lovely pop stylings and electronic non sense. My first album download for 2013 and one I am real happy with. While I won't be able to attend the cast due to being away, I will try to stream it over my phone to enjoy it with all you awesome folks. Except for kkit. Fuck that guy.

=== Larsen / Erroneous: A Selection of Errors / Call Me, Tell Me ===
Larsen is this fucked up weird experimental band from Italy. I got tuned into em in the late 90s via Swans Michael Gira producing them without being able to physically see them in the studio. On top of this, it is a collaboration with Nurse with Wound who have been SUPER weird longer than most of us have been alive. enjoy this beautiful piece of  droney kraut/post rock.

=== Shanir Ezra Blumenkranz / Abraxas: Book of Angels Vol. 19 / Tse'an ===
Zorn wrote a few hundred songs for different angels, then had different artists interpret and record them. I bet I've played one of these sometime in the last five years. This one is klezmer rock. Klezmer rock!

=== Wolfgang Dauner Quintet / The Oimels / Oh Baby I Don't Love You Anymore  ===
Dirty old psych jazz to send off 2012. This year was pretty kind to me but it's time to move on. Oh baby, I don't love you anymore.

I don't really know anything about this band, their music, or even this song.  What I do know is that every time this song comes on the radio in the car, I wind up having a great beebopping time singing along.

=== Japanese Telecom / Virtual Geisha / Cigarette Lighter ===
One of my long time favorite electro projects. Thought I'd shine a light on them. It's a spinoff of the drexciya crew with a slightly more japanese centered twist to it.
