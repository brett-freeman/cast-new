=== Dizzy Gillespie & Charlie Parker / Diz 'n Bird at Carnegie Hall 1947 / Groovin' High ===

Um, just some early bebop jazz from the greats, not much else to say except just dig these cats.

=== Christ. / Distance Lends Enchantment To The View / Animus  ===
I Rarely listen to music anymore, as anyone who talked to me knows its mostly a book playing in my right ear, but iv moved away from town now and have a 45min bus ride to reach town, so when stoned iv started playing some music again, and i forgot the simple pleasure of a magical song filling up the audio space wile scenery is going past the window... Anyway Christ. is a single man band who until 1995 colaborated with Boards of canada, and is credited at least on the Twoism album. Distance Lends Enchantment To The View is his next to latest album and i fucking love it. (ps to caster, just pm me and iÂ´ll get you a mp3 or flac of the song)

=== Ed Sheeran / + / Lego House ===
He has been around for a bit but wasn't too popular. I recently started listening to his music and basically love it, and his music videos are pretty cool as well.

=== The Heavy / The Glorious Dead / Short Change Hero ===

Now you all may recognise this song from Borderlands 2. That's because it is, but this song, nay this whole album is just a smooth ride of funkadelia.

=== ? / ? / Rocket Ship ===
I downloaded this single from someplace, it isn't ID3 tagged so I don't know what artist it is! It's a catchy little bit of electropop with a nice beat.

=== Triptonus / Unreleased (Soundcloud) / Psychotomimetikum ===
A local and young band from Vienna. Seen them live about 3 times now and growing ever more fond of their music. A nice, fresh view on classic 70s psychedelica with some african and electronic elements, elaborate song structures and you can see them  having fun playing their songs!

=== Electric Moon / The Doomsday Machine / Kleiner Knaller ===
 Some krautpsych. Tich apparently picked a solo project or something by one of the band members maybe. 
 This is the only track that was a radio-friendly length.

=== DJ Food / The Search Engine / All Covered in Darkness (Pt.1)  ===
OK, I kind of had to come up with a pick at the last minute and I haven't been listening to a lot of new stuff. But this tune is in my playlist of random new things and it's pretty catchy. The whole album has a really nice flow and I'm a huge fan of DJ Food's old stuff.

=== Propagandhi / Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes / The Purina Hall of Fame ===
Nobody ever picks punk/hardcore for these things, and this is what happens when you give angry Canadian prairie boys (like myself) some electric guitars, and a stage to preach on.  I've seen them 15+ times,  I left the show injured 3 times,  17 stitches to the head being the worst.  This one is about factory farms or some shit...

I recently bought a decrepit 1986 BMW 325es and I want to just drive it around some back roads while this entire album plays, but especially this song.

=== Wax Tailor / Dusty Rainbow from the Dark / Dusty Rainbow (feat. Charlotte Savary) ===

Absolutely digging all of the Wax Tailor tracks, as I'm a big fan of sampled music and turntablism, but I felt this was the most 'cast-worthy track.
