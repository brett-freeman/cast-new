=== Van Halen / A Different Kind of Truth / Stay Frosty ===

Whether or not this is fresh is debatable, but it is new, and it is David Lee Roth with Van Halen, and it is cool. The first record I bought was Van Halen I, and the only time I ever went to a record store before they opened to get a new release was Diver Down. (That didn't work out very well, they didn't get the shipment until noon. Also, that 1982 release was the last good Halen record before this one.) The dude who turned me onto Halen, when I was a boy not yet finished with my first decade of incarnation, was my best friend Josh's brother, an authentic hesher who never went anywhere without a brush in his back pocket and presumably a doobie in the ash tray of his Pinto. Smokin' for Josh and his stoner bro today; and also for you, #420 -- 50 bongcasts is a remarkable accomplishment!

=== Unicorn Trap / MEAT SOUNDS / The Missing Link ===

The unleashing of another new track of mine, with the goal of it being ready for mastering by this bongcast. Originally a jam session where 3 of us played over the same drums several times, it has since been re-recorded, cut, spliced and made into something better. 

What genre do you tag this as? I played it for my wife today and she said it was "disturbing"

ARE YOU READY? ARE YOU READY YOUSE GUYS?

=== Explosions in the Sky / TEINACDP / Your Hand In Mine ===

It's bongcast #50, so I thought rather than pick something that was new or newly interesting to me, I would pay respect to the achievement that is 50 straight months of our special event and pick a song that sort of defines that musical period for me.  In the last five years, my music tastes have changed quite a bit, headed here and there and everywhere - influenced in large part by the denizens of #420 as well as the bongcasts themselves, have no doubt - but there's just one album that sticks out as the singular piece of continuity in that period.  That album, of course, is The Earth Is Not A Cold Dead Place, which I have loved from the first time I listened to it about 6 years ago, to this very day.  I chose the best song from the album (and one of the most beautiful pieces of music I've ever had the pleasure of hearing) for this cast.  I've listened to this song hundreds upon hundreds of time, and it continues to evoke strong emotions every time I hear it.  It is a piece of music I have loved and I look forward to sharing it with everyone on this great anniversary of our Bongcast and as we all look forward to 50 more!

=== Emeli Sandé / Daddy / Daddy (Ifan Dafyyd Remix) ===

Ifan Dafyyd shows us what 'hypersoul' is all about with his emotive rework of an original Emeli Sandé tune. I can't get enough of his style as recently, tight synth work, smooth sub frequencies, chopped and pitched soul vocals all set in a light hearted 2step vibe. Grab a spliff with this one, they pair nicely.

=== Galactic / Carnivale Electricos / Hey Na Na ===
First, funk from New Orleans and you can't go wrong. Add to that the fact that Stanton Moore is among the most talented drummers anyway and you have an easy win. Their newest album with some great tunes but if you really want a feel for them I'd highly recommend seeing them live..among the best shows I've seen.

Screaming high brass and stylish sax funk driven at breakneck pace by the talented drumming styles of Mr. Buddy Rich. Enjoy!

=== Monkey3 / Beyond The Black Sky / Motorcycle Broer ===
I thought this tune would be a fitting candidate to celebrate this 50th anniversary bongcast and the announcement of Monkey3 playing Desertfest. Can't wait to rock out to this with Strings and Dimethyltrip! :D Also "Beyond The Black Sky" is arguably one of the best offerings when it comes to solid stoner rock in 2011 and we've not had Monkey3 for a bongcast pick yet (only intro..).

From my all-time favorite band, Various Artists, comes another classic hit. The real artists names are just the track title, hope it's agreeable.

=== Philip D Kick / Footwork Jungle Volume 1 / Omni Trio - Renegade Snares (footwork edit) ===

Classic jungle song, revamped with some characteristics of Chicago juke house. I loves me some drum machines. A combination of an old genre that I've fallen in love with and a newly growing genre that I've just become familiar with makes me glad to have familiarized myself with electronic music, something that is tied closely to my participation on OiNK->what/waffles and my greater personal involvement with internet communities. Here's to 50 more!

=== James Brown / Soul Pride: The Instrumentals 1960-69 / Lowdown Popcorn (buttered version) ===

Lowdown Popcorn definition: Nasty, greasy, old school funk jam. No talk and all walk. Drenched in butter fat. An addictive ear snack. A beat that talks loud to you and﻿ does not allow you to talk back, only nod your head, pop your neck, snap your finger, etc.
