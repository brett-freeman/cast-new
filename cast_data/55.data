=== The Phantom Family Halo / When I Fall Out / Lightning on Your Face ===
If this music isn't creepy psych enough for you, maybe the Kentucky origins will freak you out.

=== Moon Curse / Moon Curse / Black Elk ===

The dark lords beneath the depths of Lake Michigan have summoned forth from beyond space and time the serious volume and immense riffage of 3 piece practitioners of doom, Moon Curse.

=== Soen / Cognitive / Delenda ===

I have been gone for quite some time,  but I'm back.  Yes,  EnrageD for his turn picks another Opeth related track,  however the only similarities this time is the drummer, Martin Lopez.   It's so nice to hear Martin back in action with such a great band.   Pay attention to the rhythm section,  one of the best in Metal right now.   I had a really tough song deciding to pick this track, Delenda, or Purpose.   So if you like this, check out "Purpose".

Superb spaced out psych from the Netherlands is going to take you to a place where the sky meets the earth and echoes can be heard forever...
