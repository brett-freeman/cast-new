=== Yawning Man / 2013 Desertfest Tour Split / Underwater Noise ===
Those guys dragged me out to the desert and left me standing there all alone. I felt the warm wind in my face (actually my hair) and let my soul wander aimlessly. They were so freaking good at desertfest I saw them again a week later in Vienna, got an LP with signatures and a tour shirt!

Nice and pissed off bongcast pick for me, dedicated to the Swiss. French bands kinda suck but these guys are killer

=== The Shins / Port of Morrow / Simple Song ===
Once in a while there's a song that I hear that I think to myself "this is a flawlessly perfect recording" and then I spam the song on repeat for 6 months and it joins itself with several others in the hall of song fame in my mind.  This is the first song I've put on that mental list sing "Skinny Love" and it's just absolutely incredible.

I think it's been a long time since we've heard Gayngs or Bon Iver on the cast and I've recently rediscovered Gayngs and have been loving it. If you don't know these guys or Bon Iver, go grab it all immediately.

This song goes bleep and bloop. It is better than the new Daft Punk.

=== Bengt SÃ¤ndh /  / Ett Recpet ===
A swedish song, banned from radio still, caused a lot of controversy when it came out, it perfectly describes how to make alcohol, the fermentation and the distillation, ends with Bengt singing his real home number implying that if u make the booze, he will bring the pickled herring and potatoes. ;)

=== The Madd Wikkid / Brassft Punk / One More Time ===
With the leak of Random Access Memories this week, I figured I'd throw in the reworking of an old Daft Punk track, one that's made me pick back up my trumpet after not playing for a few years. Not sure if there are many brass band fans in here but I hope you enjoy the arrangement, tight percussion and chords, great use of dynamics, and the bit of banter at the end between the trumpet and sax.
