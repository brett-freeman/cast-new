TBH I had an impossible time figuring out which song to pick, Cheating the Polygraph or Normal, so I let entr0py pick for me.

=== Thievery Corporation / Sounds from the Thievery Hi-Fi / 38.45 (A Thievery Number) ===

I couldn't make up my mind between this song, and Current Value - Dark Rain... so I flipped a coin and this came out.

I try not to pick bands that I think a decent amount of folks might already be familiar with but I can't get enough of this track. Lush, dreamy,  and delicious. Dreamsicle..mmm

=== Al Stewart / Famous Last Words / Trespasser ===

http://www.grenwolth.com/Pictures/famous_last_words.jpg

I snagged Al Stewart's discography a while back and had never heard this album before, even though it was released in 1993. One nice thing about Al Stewart is that he's always a real easy acoustical fix.

=== Screamin Jay Hawkins / I Put a Spell on You / I Put a Spell on You ===
Here's something Halloween appropriate for you. Screamin Jay was an insane performer, look him up on [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orNpH6iyokI youtube]], and apparently fathered at least 75 children.

=== Woodkid / Run Boy Run / Run Boy Run ===
Works better with the video, but this song is a pure stonker. Epic pounding, cinematic orchestral themes and a climactic finish. Much like sex with me. You're welcome.
