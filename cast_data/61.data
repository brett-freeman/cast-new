Psych weird free folk from a loner named Damon McMahon who hid in a remote Catskills cabin and veiled himself within the crowds of Beijing to come up with this far out nonsense.

=== The:Egocentrics / Center of the Cyclone / The Unknown Sings ===
Well, I'm not really deviating from my usual sort of pick this time either, but you guys seem to like it. Here is some great stuff from Romania, those guys deserve a lot more attention! I've seen them live last year, some of the songs they dragged out to never-ending jams ranging from jazz to psychedelia, always aiming straight at space.

=== The Flashbulb / Arboreal / Undiscovered Colors ===
I heard this on a youtube video the other day and fell in love with it. The slow build of the percussive violin leading up to the polyrhythmic (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyrhythm) tack piano line and glitch-synth verse. I find it's harder and harder to find rhythmically complex tracks and really appreciated the layering found in this one. I hope you all do too.

I found this while traversing some tags on what. Apparently it's an Italian band whose exact lineup is unknown. You get a long song, host's privilege.

=== Rick Ross / Django Unchained OST / 100 Black Coffins ===
This is a track that shouldnt work with its films accompanying genre but does, despite being done by a fake assed rapper with minimal skills at best. Django Unchained has to be the best film I've ever seen on so many levels. Enjoy, BC61
